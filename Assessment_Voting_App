# ASSIGNMENT 4 : VOTING APP

# All Commands:
* `git clone  https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app`
* `cd  /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications`
* `kubectl apply -f .`
* `kubectl delete pod vote-125884cd0-69zas`
* `kubectl delete pod worker-23asdjodf-4gf5a`
* `kubectl delete pod db-gfar23sdg-lk1kt`
* `kubectl logs -f result-s51w4323sg-as5a5`


# Observations:
1. After deleting voting pod:
  * Command - `kubectl delete po vote-125884cd0-69zas`
  * New instance gets creating after deleting old one :
     "vote-125884cd0-69zas" -> "vote-125884cd0-521ua"
  * Voting application working as expected.
     
2. After deleting worker pod:
  * Command - `kubectl delete po worker-23asdjodf-4gf5a`
  * New instance gets creating after deleting old one :
      "worker-23asdjodf-4gf5a" -> "worker-23asdjodf-asj51"
  * Voting application working as expected.
  
3. After db pod deletion?
  * Command - `kubectl delete po db-gfar23sdg-lk1kt`
  * The application stopped working due to connection got closed between result and db pod. That is why results not get updated even if after voting. Voting for Dogs and Cats became equal i.e stats got reset. Showed in result pod log.
  ```
  [root@ip-172-31-11-190 k8s-specifications]# kubectl logs -f result-s51w4323sg-as5a5

  * db pod now running with new data set.
  * Worker pod service restarted once. Deleted worker pod to see if result updated or not but still the same.
